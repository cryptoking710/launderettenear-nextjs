⚠️ Critical Issues
1. JavaScript Rendering Problem

Issue: The site appears to be heavily JavaScript-dependent, which prevented content from loading during my fetch attempt
Impact: Search engine crawlers may struggle to index your content, severely hurting SEO
Recommendation: Implement Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) using Next.js or similar framework

2. No Visible Content to Crawlers

Issue: Zero HTML content was returned when fetching the page
Impact: Google and other search engines may see a blank page
Fix: Ensure critical content (listings, city names, reviews) is rendered server-side
